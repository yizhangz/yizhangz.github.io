FGL: The last time I saw you was Oct. 2014 when I was studying TOEFL at XDF, Weigong Chun. I remember that you were with JS then and we recognized each other at a glance. PX: Long time no see. The nickname Big Bird is quite weird 2333, but you are definitely a nice guy. Good luck with the interview. YZ: Your name sounds identical to mine which often embarrassed us at school (especially when we were classmates). You are very friendly and good-natured. Though I was quiet at school and didn’t used to play with girls, we still had a few conversations. CL: We had been classmates for three years, but only since college did we get familiar with each other. You are enthusiastic and a little boyish which makes you easy to get along with. HZ: You were a member of the Special Interest Group on Physics, No.1 High School, JA, 2010-2012. You used to ask many questions which is very impressive. FXL: Happy birthday! I am glad that you have receive the offer from your dream school which would certainly be the best birthday present. You are an independent person who have her own ideas and have aspiration to become a professional too. I am sure you will have a good life in the future.","tags":[]},{"title":"Hello World","date":"2017-02-25T15:47:03.318Z","path":"2017/02/25/hello-world/","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
